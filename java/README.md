# public-api-sheriff
Example usage of the Sheriff Public API using Java

##Prerequisite
  - [Get Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) for your platform (used jdk 8u25)
  - [json-simple](https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/) - if this project disapears I can add the .jar to github

##Example
This was only a simple demo using java 1.8.0_25 on Windows
As long as java and javac are in your path the following will work

```
$ go
```

I have not bothered to get it to build with [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/), [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), nor has there been other testing on any other platform - sorry.
