# public-api-sheriff
Example usage of the Sheriff Public API using Ruby

##Prerequisite
  - [Get Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) for your platform

I believe I'm using what's included (no gems)

##Example
Depending on your platform one of the following should work:

```
$ ruby current-arrest.rb
```

```
$ chmod u+x current-arrest.rb
$ ./current-arrest.rb
```

Replace current-arrest.rb above with the name of the other example.
