# public-api-sheriff
Example usage of the Sheriff Public API using Python

##Prerequisite
  - [Get Python](https://www.python.org/) for your platform

I believe I'm using what's included (no eggs or packages)

##Example
Depending on your platform one of the following should work:

```
$ python current-arrest.py
```

```
$ chmod u+x current-arrest.py
$ ./current-arrest.py
```

Replace current-arrest.py above with the name of the other example.
